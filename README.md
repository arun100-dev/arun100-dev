👋 Hi, I'm Arun Sharma

💻 Software Development Engineer
Full-Stack Developer with strong foundations in Data Structures, Backend Engineering, and System-Oriented Thinking.

💼 About Me

🎓 B.Tech in Electronics and Communication

I build scalable full-stack applications with a strong focus on backend architecture, authentication systems, and clean code structure.

🔧 Experienced with the MERN stack (React, Node.js, Express, MongoDB)

🧠 Strong grasp of Data Structures & Algorithms

⚙️ Interested in scalable backend systems and REST API design

📚 Continuously improving system design and performance fundamentals

As a fresher, I focus on understanding how systems work internally, not just how to build features.
